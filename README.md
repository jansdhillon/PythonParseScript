# PythonParseScript

Each participant does 10 trials of 6 tasks and their times and accuracies for each task is recorded. There are two differnt interaction techniques tested 
and each participant does the experiment for both techniques, yielding 10 trials (of 6 tasks) or 60 tasks per participant and 300 total data entries per 
technique. There are 50 trial files per technique. This data was collected from my COSC 341 class where I conducted this experiment to compare the 
statistical differences between the two techniques.Expanding Targets has the targets expand when the mouse gets closer and 
Order Frequency reorders the targets based on how frequently they are clicked.

The script organizes the data into csv files for easy analysis.
